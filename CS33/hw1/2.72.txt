A.)When a signed integer is subtracted from an unsigned integer, the result is always an unsigned integer because of the implicit promotion that occcurs in C.
Because the result is an unsigned integer, this implies that the conditional expression is always satsified as unsigned integers are (by definition) >= 0.

B.) if (maxbytes - ((int) sizeof(val)) >= 0); 
We can use type casting to avoid this issue.
