The value of the expression returns 16. This is because of the way alignment works.

The first character is at offset 0. The next char b, is specified to have an alignemnt of 8, so it is moved to an offset of 8. 
Finally the last char c is placed in between an offset of 9.  Bytes that do not contain a char are filled with junk.
Because the farthest offset of a data member is a number betweeen 8 and 16 and because the largest alignment of a data member in the struct is 8,
we have to round the entire size up to the next multiple of 8, which is 16. Thus the size of that struct is 16.
