A) The bug is that main never waits for the thread it created.

B) 
int main() {
  pthread_t tid;
  
  Pthread_create(&tid, NULL, thread, NULL);

  Pthread_exit(NULL);
}

Looking at the code for echo_cnt, it IS thread-safe. The mutex (binary sempaphore) properly protects byte_cnt with P and V operations
such that only one thread can modify byte_cnt at a time

However, the function is NOT re-entrant. Each call to the function SHARES the same mutex meaning that function calls are NOT independent of one another, they share
some semblance of "state".
